### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PowerShell developer with an emphasis on developer tooling.
I'm working on learning Go + HTMX and I use neovim btw, with some occasional Arch.

Primary Projects:
- [OpnLab](https://github.com/NachoxMacho/opnlab): New experimental project
- [School Projects](https://github.com/NachoxMacho/Projects): Older college projects

Fun fact: I run my own kubernetes cluster for funsies at home
